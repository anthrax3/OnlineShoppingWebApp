Ecommerce web application with paypal payment gateway.
##
The main idea of the thesis was to develop an E-commerce Web Application by using payment gateway (PayPal payment technology) for an online shop which was developed by ASP.NET framework (version 4.6.2) and Microsoft SQL server management studio, where a seller (Owner of the Web shop) will be able to put all the products in the online shop, and a customer who is a buyer will be able to buy items through online payment. This application has two different views: Public view and Administrator (in short Admin) view. Admin view refers to the owner of the online shop who can manage the application as well maintain products and customers. The public view is made for clients or users for viewing and ordering products. 
#
A user can search and view items from the online store. Only a registered user can buy products from the shop by using PayPal payment technology. Without the registration, it is not possible to check out through PayPal payment. This application has registration and login features for a user. A registered user can manage the own account. Registered customers can see their purchase history and can update profile information from their own account page. 
#

Administrator of the web shop can add, edit and delete products from the store. He can update and remove a registered customerâ€™s information. As well, all the orders made by the customers will be available to the admin. Admin can update shipping information. Item stock and sale report will be shown to the admin.
